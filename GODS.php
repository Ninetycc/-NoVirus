<p><iframe title="The Gods Never Left Us: The Long Awaited Sequel to the Worldwide Best-seller Chariots of the Gods" type="text/html" width="1200" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?preview=inline&#038;linkCode=kpd&#038;ref_=k4w_oembed_nk3TapAe0RkXIV&#038;asin=163265119X&#038;tag=kpembed-20"></iframe></p>
<p>When Chariots of the Gods was published 50 years ago, it began a worldwide change in humanity&#8217;s view of the cosmos. In an era of the military space race, <br />
Erich von D√§niken boldly proclaimed that Earth had been visited by more advanced beings early in our history. <br />
But prescientific man had no concept of space ships, so he called their vehicles &#8220;chariots,&#8221; and those driving the chariots became &#8220;gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next five decades, von D√§niken&#8217;s more than 40 books built an ever-stronger case for Earth being visited by extraterrestrial visitors. And Chariots became an international best<br /> seller, with 30 million copies sold in more than two dozen languages.<br /> Also during that time, the case for ET visitations millennia ago was being reexamined by contemporary UFO researchers,<br /> who found evidence of modern visitations. And von D√§niken expanded his perspective to encompass the present.</p>
<p>Now, he presents his long-awaited sequel to Chariots of the Gods, proclaiming that the gods never left us with all-new material to show that ancient aliens are still with us.</p>
<p>The Gods Never Left Us contends that recent advancements in biotechnology, astrophysics, engineering, <br />
and artificial intelligence not only give us a fresh perspective on his ancient astronaut theory but actually validates it. <br />
We are&#8211;as a race&#8211;embarking on the exact same trajectory of our own interplanetary colonization, <br />
just as von D√§niken suggested Earth itself was colonized.</p>
<p>ETs are definitely at work today. And that affects all of us.</p>
<p>Why do they do what they do? What could an extraterrestrial species possibly gain from observing us in the same way we look at ants?<br />
What have these strangers wanted for the past thousands of years?<br />
Can&#8217;t they leave us alone?<br />
And what makes it so difficult for us to acknowledge the existence of these extraterrestrials?<br />
That is what this book deals with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Erich&#8217;s newest book is a fascination journey from the ancient past into the present with a plethora of scientific evidence and documented research.<br /> As always, he ads his own &#8220;to the point&#8221; take on it all.<br /> Readers may also like that his newest work moves in a slightly different direction from his past books. A thoroughly enlightening and enjoyable Read.&#8221; &#8211;Bruce Cunningham, Director,<br /> Ancient Mysteries International LLC &#038; Publisher of Advanced Archaeology Review magazin</p>

<h3>Escaping from Eden:</h3>
<h2>Does Genesis Teach That the Human Race Was Created by God or Engineered by Ets?</h2>
<p> Paperback ‚Äì 1 June 2020<br />

<h5>The familiar stories of the book of Genesis affirm that God made the universe, planet earth, and you and me. </br>
However, various anomalies in the text clue us that we are not reading the original version of these stories. </br>
So what were the original narratives and what did they say about who we are and where we all came from? </br>
What was the earlier story of human origins, almost obliterated from the Hebrew Scriptures in the 6th century BC, </br>
and suppressed from Christian writing in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD? And what does any of this have to do with Extra Terrestrials?</br> 
Escaping from Eden will take you on a journey around the world and into the mythologies of ancient Sumeria, </br>
Mesoamerica, India, Africa, and Greece to reveal a profound secret, hidden in plain sight in the text of the Bible. </br>
Far reaching and deeply controversial, this book points to truths about ourselves, the universe and everything that you may have long suspected but not dared to speak!</h5>

<b>Guys just finished the book Bossi suggested - Escaping from Eden. </br> 
I found it fascinating, especially in relation to old testament stories </br>
I'd struggled with in the past. He looks at Elohim and elohim quite a bit (just a taste below)</b>

<b>"Whether Christianity would simply import contemporary Judaism's reading of the elohom stories as God-stories was not a foregone conclusion. </br>
Even within the pages of the Gospels and the book of Acts we can hear the push and pull of debate as the early Christians decided how much of Judaism Christianity to confirm.</br>
My questions around the translation of 'elohim' had shone light on a whole number of God-stories that may not be God-stories after all.</br>

<b>And another interesting bit from 'Escaping from Eden'</b>


<b>"According to Genesis, the Sumerian tablets and the Popol Vuh, 
not only were we mentally programmed for a life of slavery but our mental capacities and powers of perception were downgraded. 
To maximise our usefulness to our overlords, our brains default settings were deliberately turned down."</b>
